<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Employees join and leave jobs for many different reasons. This project utilizes machine learning to model and predict employee status (active, attrition). 

*  User-Driven Data Gathering using HTML forms and SQLite (with Python)
*  Mimic an HR group corporate tool [using an example HR dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set)
*  Leverage Scikit + Python to develop a model that adapts to newly-entered data to continually form predictions

###### Concept & Notes
1. Questions we could potentially answer:
  - Can we predict when an employee will leave a job?
  - Can we predict the _percentage_ of employees that will leave a job? or stay?

2. Our technologies include:
  - Flask-powered API
  - SQLite
  - Pandas
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Scikit-Learn
  - Kaggle
  - Tensorflow
