<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Employees join and leave jobs for many different reasons. This project utilizes machine learning to model and predict when an employee may decide to leave their job. 

*  User-Driven Data Gathering
*  
*  

###### Requirements

1. Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing
  -Can we predict when an employee will leave a job?

2. Use ML in the context of technologies learned

3. You must use:
  - Scikit-Learn
  - and/or another machine learning library
 
4. Our technologies include:
  - Python Flask-powered API
  - HTML/CSS
  - JavaScript
  - SQLite
  - Pandas
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Scikit-Learn
  
5. Host Application using Heroku or tool of your choice (Github Pages)

8. Prepare a 15-minute data deep-dive or infrastructure walkthrough that shows
   machine learning in the context of what we've already learned
